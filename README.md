# LCSOffroadRacer

This project is a class project for Liberty Christian School - LCS Game Design. 
Assets are captured under educational exemption and cited by source. 

Important Note: There are things we do in this project that may not be the most efficient,
but are done using the tools that the students have at their disposal at the time of the project
(which is the halfway point of our Game Design 1 class).

The goals of this project are: 
- Get students used to working in a team environment, including tools such as shared code repositories.
- Get students involved in the design and asset creation process. 
- Have students design interdependent, but self-sustaining, classes.

We make no assertion that this code is usable as examples of how to do things. Use anything here at your own risk.
